# bet-app
An app that provides useful information for football betting.

The app was developed using React Native and is powered by an API that provides data about leagues and teams from around the world.

The purpose of the app is to provide essential data for bettors to analyze the game.

So far, only the first page of the app has been implemented, which shows the games of the selected day, which by default is the current day.
